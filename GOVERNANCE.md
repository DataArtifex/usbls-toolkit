# Project Governance

## Overview

The US BLS Toolkit is an open-source project that welcomes contributions from the community. This document outlines the governance structure of the project and the processes for making decisions.

## Governance Model

This project follows a **Benevolent Dictator** governance model, which is common for small, open-source projects with limited maintainers.

## Project Leadership

### Project Lead/Maintainer
- **Pascal Heus** (@kulnor) - Project founder and primary maintainer

### Responsibilities of Project Lead
- Setting overall project direction and vision
- Making final decisions on feature additions and changes
- Managing releases and versioning
- Reviewing and merging pull requests
- Maintaining project infrastructure
- Ensuring adherence to the Code of Conduct

## Decision-Making Process

### Day-to-Day Decisions
- Bug fixes, documentation updates, and minor improvements can be implemented directly by the project lead or approved contributors
- Pull requests are reviewed and merged by the project lead

### Major Decisions
Major decisions include:
- Significant changes to project architecture or design
- Addition of new major features
- Changes to governance structure
- Licensing changes
- Breaking changes to public APIs

**Process for Major Decisions:**
1. Discussion is initiated via GitHub Issues
2. Community feedback is gathered and considered
3. Final decision is made by the project lead
4. Decision is documented and communicated to the community

## Contributing

### How to Contribute
1. Review the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
2. Check existing [Issues](https://github.com/DataArtifex/usbls-toolkit/issues) and [Pull Requests](https://github.com/DataArtifex/usbls-toolkit/pulls)
3. For bug fixes and minor improvements: submit a pull request directly
4. For new features or major changes: open an issue for discussion first

### Contributor Recognition
- All contributors are acknowledged in release notes
- Significant contributors may be invited to become project collaborators
- Contributors retain copyright on their contributions under the project's MIT license

## Project Roles

### Contributors
- Anyone who contributes code, documentation, or other improvements
- No special permissions required
- Contributions acknowledged in project history

### Collaborators (Future)
As the project grows, trusted contributors may be invited to become collaborators with:
- Write access to the repository
- Ability to review and merge pull requests
- Input on major project decisions

### Maintainers
- Currently limited to the project lead
- Full repository access and administrative rights
- Responsibility for project direction and releases

## Communication

### Primary Channels
- **GitHub Issues** - Bug reports, feature requests, and technical discussions
- **GitHub Discussions** - General questions and community discussions
- **Pull Requests** - Code reviews and implementation discussions

### Response Times
- The project lead aims to respond to issues and pull requests within 1-2 weeks
- Critical security issues will be addressed as quickly as possible
- Response times may vary based on maintainer availability

## Conflict Resolution

### Process
1. Most conflicts should be resolved through respectful discussion in GitHub Issues or Pull Requests
2. If discussion becomes unproductive, the project lead may make a final decision
3. For conflicts involving the project lead, escalation to a neutral third party may be considered
4. Violations of the Code of Conduct will be handled according to its enforcement procedures

## Changes to Governance

This governance document may be updated as the project evolves. Changes will be:
1. Proposed via GitHub Issue or Pull Request
2. Open for community discussion for at least 2 weeks
3. Decided by the project lead with consideration of community input
4. Documented with clear reasoning

## License and Legal

- All contributions must be compatible with the project's MIT license
- Contributors must have the right to contribute their code
- By contributing, contributors agree to license their work under the project's MIT license
- No Contributor License Agreement (CLA) is currently required

## Project Evolution

As the project grows, this governance structure may evolve to:
- Include additional maintainers or a steering committee
- Implement more formal voting procedures
- Establish technical advisory groups for specific areas

**Future Governance Model**: If the project community grows significantly, we would ideally transition from the current Benevolent Dictator model to a **Liberal Contribution** governance model. This would feature:
- Distributed decision-making among trusted maintainers
- Lower barriers to contribution and commit access
- Emphasis on trust and post-commit review rather than pre-commit gatekeeping
- Self-organizing teams around different functional areas
- Consensus-based decisions for major changes

Any such changes will be made transparently with community input.
